# Soil Monitor
Monitor humidity of soil to remind me when to water my plants using an Arduino Uno.

## Materials Used

- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard
- LCD Display (16 x 2)
- Potentiometer
- Soil Sensor (YL-69)
- Photoresistor board
- 2 LEDs
- 2 220 Ohm resistors
- Assorted wires

The photoresistor is included in order to only monitor the system when there is ambient light so that the system can be left plugged in and the LEDs will automatically turn off at night.

P.S. This took longer to draw than actually building the project.
